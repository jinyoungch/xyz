I've finally settled down, after having been on the move for the past year and a half. 

After a cohosting a workshop in [Guatemala](https://youtu.be/41O5mTJ_tnU?t=15) and staying in the country for two weeks to explore its wonderful coffeelands, I finished things off in Atlanta upon my graduation, then headed over to Portugal for five weeks to study the Portuguese language. 

Next, I was off on a work trip to [Tanzania](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13skTHbeOnTvYvPPq2eBlGeugpEM2kCSu/view), then made a return to England to see my brother Ryan graduate, visited my friend Josep in Paris for a weekend, went to Iceland on a family trip, and made a brief stop in Korea until taking off again to Panama where I worked and lived for six months.  

Due to my prolonged absence from the US, I was starting to get worried about my permanent residence being taken away at immigration so, at the height of the pandemic, I am back in the States. 

In between the nomadic journey and finally returning to the US for good, I was graced by the opportunity to spend six months in my hometown Daejeon. 

Those six months were, for the most part, spent at home, whereby I devoted myself towards retrospecting my journey, and cultivating my growing understanding of this new field I have begun to take quite seriously. 

With all the stops I made in the past year and half, I am finding myself returning to the city I have gotten to love: Asheville, North Carolina. 

This is the place that was my homebase during the summer of 2018, where I took up a seasonal job in [forestry](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP9FlB0t6ai6QTJMRg-DwC5vnGc5ekyJyn63pBYhOZ8ZH0eDExNzjF0PrLoHtolcA?key=Q3B3eW5GbEZJSkNPUmV1RmpVN1hUMy1oRk1YWjR3). 

And my decision to live here for the next six months is my deliberate attempt to reconnect with a place that is so dear to my identity. 

The Southern Appalachians are where I had finally become comfortable with my [self-identity](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1752903158112310&set=t.100001779277141&type=3) two years ago, having lived as a foreigner of other's cultures for more than a decade. 

It's really come full circle.

Here, I will be continuing to challenge my understanding of software development, work on a backlogged list of projects, and build up my knowledge in data structures and algorithms so that I can be ready for a job as a software enginner towards the end of my time here. 

What am I most excited about? 

The [multigenerational commune](https://www.instagram.com/westwoodcohoavl/) that will be my home for the near future, and the colours of leaves exploding into autumn. :)
